# rust_gpt_cli
A CLI tool to interface with the ChatGPT API from the command line.

I built this to be able to use ChatGPT from my preffered CLI. It allows you to have relatively coherent conversations for about 20-30 mesages before the the context window gets a little screw-y. All that is needed is an OpenAI API Key and you're off to the races. A short Demo and better instructions on the way.
